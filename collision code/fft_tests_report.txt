TEST: FFT Poisson solver - single cosine mode
  k2 (mode 1,0,0) = 1.522409e-01
  L2 relative error = 2.600e-08
  max abs error     = 2.524e-08
  PASS (FFT solver reproduces single-mode solution)

TEST: FFT Poisson solver - superposition of two modes
  L2 relative error = 6.532e-08
  max abs error     = 1.004e-07
  PASS (FFT solver reproduces two-mode superposition)

TEST: FFT Poisson solver - full 3D mode
  k2 (mode 1,1,2) = 8.902683e-01
  L2 relative error = 6.388e-08
  max abs error     = 1.435e-07
  PASS (FFT solver reproduces 3D mode)

TEST: FFT Poisson solver - DC (constant) RHS
  L2 relative error (vs zero) = 0.000e+00
  max abs potential           = 0.000e+00
  PASS (FFT solver correctly handles DC mode by zeroing potential)
